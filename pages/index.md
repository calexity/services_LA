  Unhoused residents often experience randomly scheduled sweeps and lose vital
  personal belongings, which leads to mental health trauma and hopelessness.
  They deserve better notice and better treatment from the city.


  They also continue to die at an alarming rate-- 917 in 2018, up from 831 in
  2017-- many due to treatable health conditions. Our unhoused neighbors need
  better public health infrastructure and services, not sweeps and
  criminalization.
