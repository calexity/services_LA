  Unhoused residents who experience randomly scheduled sweeps often lose vital
  personal belongings, which often leads to mental health trauma and
  hopelessness. **They deserve better notice and better treatment from the

  many due to treatable health conditions. Our unhoused neighbors need better
  public health infrastructure and services, not sweeps and criminalization.Ã‚
